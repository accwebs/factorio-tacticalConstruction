    "description": "Tactical Construction provides a per-player toggle that - when enabled - prioritizes the local player's roboport for construction requests (as opposed to allowing construction requests to be satisfied by any statically-placed logistics network that overlaps inside the player's mobile roboport). CAUTION: This mod applies force changes to any game loaded with the mod active; these changes are not reverted if you later disable the mod, unless you first instruct this mod to undo the changes to your file(s). Please read the full mod description so you know what you're getting into. This mod is still in BETA; you may encounter crashes/corruption."
