    "description": "Tactical Construction provides a per-player toggle that - when enabled - prioritizes the local player's roboport for construction requests (as opposed to allowing construction requests to be satisfied by any statically-placed logistics network that overlaps inside the player's mobile roboport). CAUTION: This mod is still in BETA; you may encounter crashes/corruption."
