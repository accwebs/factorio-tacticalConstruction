Version: 0.1.4
Date: 2020-04-18
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when a scenario or other mod script is altering the player force upon map creation (before mod init).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2020-03-28
  Info:
    - No real functional changes with this version; simply revising the mod description to indicate the mod is what I would call in 'beta' stage.
      - I and my friends did some pretty extensive testing in various multiplayer games.
      - Even on our 'huge base' file, the 'alternative force' management logic in the mod has not screwed up anything in our base.
      - Even if something does get glitched out and gets 'stuck' on the 'alternative force' as long as everyone has toggled off the button, the mod does now have logic (as of v0.1.0) to ensure anything 'stuck' on the alternative force is reverted.
  Changes:
    - Update mod description (info.json and readme).
    - Add usage instructions to readme.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2020-03-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix mod to actually initialize correctly in a multiplayer game with multiple players already in it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2020-03-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix player resetting logic to move the player back to their primary force upon reset.
    - Fix player initialization logic to call update_gui() to update the full gui state (rather than just creating the gui if necessary, but not refreshing it).
  Changes:
    - Add (rather janky) thumbnail image.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2020-03-27
  Changes:
    - Major refactor of roles and responsibilities between different script files.
    - Refactor event handling/response logic to make the different interactions more understandable.
    - Redesign alternative force creation logic to ensure crash doesn't happen if a player has changed forces since joining the game.
    - Register and listen to events.on_player_changed_force and try to react if player has moved forces outside of this mod.
    - Implement much more reliable 'garbage collection' logic:
      - Runs every ~2 min. I've rather painstakenly tried to optimize this, but please report if you notice consistent lag every 2 mins.
      - Clean up the alternative forces if there are no longer any connected players that might use them.
      - Reset any disconnected player's 'toggle' state and associated gui.
  Gui:
    - Give the 'enabled' version of the feature's toggle button a yellow background to make it more intuitive that it's 'enabled'.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix script error immediately encountered in 'true' single player game (issue #4).
    - Fix players 'bleeding' robots because the script tries to restore anything outside the construction radius back to the original force (robots and player characters now excluded :-) ).
    - Don't revert all entities from alternative_force -> base_force if another player is currently living on the alternative force.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2020-03-22
  Bugfixes:
    - Back up and restore player logistic request slot counts before/after switching forces.
      - Fixes logistic request slots for the player resetting to 'zero' items upon toggling the feature.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
