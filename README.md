## Description

Logistic Network Channels is an experimental mod for the video game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). It attempts to allow the player to prioritize their local player's roboport for construction requests (as opposed to allowing construction requests to be satisfied by any statically-placed logistics network that overlaps inside the player's mobile roboport).
